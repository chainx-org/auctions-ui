##### Selling Dai to reduce system surplus

A surplus auction is the process in which the Maker Protocol auctions excess Dai for MKR in order to reduce the Dai surplus that has built up in the system primarily from stability and liquidation fees. The MKR that is used to buy the surplus Dai will be burned by the Maker Protocol, reducing the MKR Supply.

##### How does the bidding work?

The surplus auctions follow what is referred to as an ‘English Auction’. This means that you bid on fixed lots of 30,000 Dai, as determined by Maker governance, with increasing amounts of MKR. For example, if the current bid on a 30,000 Dai lot is 10 MKR (a price of 3,000 DAI per MKR), your next bid would need to be more than 10 MKR. The mechanics of the auction also require you to bid at least 4% more than the previous bid, so in this example, the next possible bid would be a minimum of 10.4 MKR (approximately 2885 DAI per MKR). Please note that bidding does incur gas fees, and the final cost will be dependent on the gas price you select.
